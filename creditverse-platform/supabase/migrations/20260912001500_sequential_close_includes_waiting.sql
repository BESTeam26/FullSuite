-- =============================================================================
-- The sequential close has to close WAITING work, which is the normal case.
--
-- `closes_department` only ended work that was ACTIONABLE. But the path Dee
-- described runs through waiting: a round is mailed, the Dispute row sits at
-- ROUND SENT - AWAITING RESULTS for thirty days, and then the file becomes
-- `Ready For Reimport / Credit Update` and belongs to Client Success /
-- Support. The Dispute row is waiting at exactly the moment it should end, so
-- the close never fired and the client appeared in both queues — the two
-- owners for one sequential step Dee ruled out.
--
-- Caught by her own regression test 42, which is why it was written.
--
-- Any OPEN row of that department now closes: actionable or waiting. Already
-- resolved rows are left alone — closing a COMPLETED row would rewrite the
-- moment it finished.
